	All have been resized to 800 px maximum width.
2.	The thumbs directory- containing 100x100 px thumbnails
2.	The _fullsize director - containing the original images_cropped from the mewb converted to png if necessary



to convert all jpg in folder to pngs:

to make thumbnails of all png images in the folder, and put them into an existing 'thumbs' folder:

To convert all thumbnails to the same size, use:

mogrify -gravity center -background white -extent 200x200 *.png

To convert all large images to 500 px width max

mogrify -path small -resample 300 -resize 800x\> *.png
